# Interactive-Top-K-Frequent-Pattern-Mining-from-Uncertain-Data
This research focus on the implementations of algorithms for mining Top-K frequent patterns from uncertain datasets.
An interactive system is developed and allows users to specify the number of top itemsets to retrieve, enhancing flexibility and efficiency in pattern discovery.

# Top-K High Utility Itemset
A Top-K High Utility Itemset is a subset of items from a transaction that has highest utility values, where the utility is measured by factors like profit, importance, or relevance.

Top-k high utility itemset mining refers to the discovery of top-k patterns using a user-specified value k by considering the utility of items in a transactional database.

# Uncertain Data
Data where the presence of an item or the utility value is uncertain or probabilistic. They are imprecise, not very helpful in reaching the conclusion and might hinder our process if we do not handle them properly.

# Positive and Negative Utility
Positive ultilities represent benefits or profits derived from items in a transaction, when an item contributes positively to an outcome. Negative ultilities represent costs, losses, or negative impacts associated with items. 

An item’s ultility are defined by many factors and contexts. A dataset can come with a pre-defined utility value or not.
